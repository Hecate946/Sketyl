    <h1>About Sketyl</h1>
    <h2>
        In case you didn't notice, Sketyl is a website. And yes, I know it looks
        terrible. It'll improve. Hopefully... Sketyl is a 100% open source
        project, and was designed with utmost speed and navigational simplicity
        as priorities. The complete source code can be found at
        <a href="https://github.com/Hecate946/Sketyl" target="_blank"
            >https://github.com/Hecate946/Sketyl</a
        >
    </h2>
    <h1>Function</h1>
    <h2>
        Sketyl shows you your favorite tracks and artists, what you've listened
        to recently, and provides audio previews for each song.
    </h2>
    <h1>Author Notes</h1>
    <h2>
        Professionalism is my forte and it shows. Doesn't it? Sketyl is a cool
        name no? It's a random 6 letter word I came up with that happened to be
        for sale on namecheap for 4 bucks. Also cool because it sounds like
        skettle, which apparently is jamaican slang for prostitutes. Fuck I
        forgot to mention that the "Recent Tracks" and the "Liked Tracks" tabs
        will probably crap out for you. Spotify hasn't approved Sketyl for that
        yet. Not my fault, so yeah my code isn't shitty just because you see
        internal server errors. Well the code is sorta shitty, but that's not
        why it craps out. Also don't come and fuck me over for using someone
        else's photograph as a background image. Yes I mean that one up there ^.
        Beautiful isn't it? The photographer's name is Jan Erik Waider. I love
        his stuff. if you want to check his work out, click
        <a
            href="https://www.northlandscapes.com/portfolio/iceland-dark-and-monochrome"
            target="_blank"
            >here.</a
        >
        Or just google him. I honestly couldn't care less what you do. Speaking
        of art, do you like the logo? Yes, the one that looks more like a
        deformed sperm than a 16th note. I drew it on the apple notes app (on my
        phone). I think I have a bright future as a digital artist wouldn't you
        agree? Or maybe even a painter?
