        <h1>About Sketyl</h1>
        <h2>In case you didn't notice, Sketyl is a website. And yes, I know it looks terrible. It'll improve.
            Hopefully... Sketyl is a 100% open source project, and was designed with utmost speed and navigational
            simplicity as priorities.
            The complete source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Hecate946/Sketyl"
                target="_blank">https://github.com/Hecate946/Sketyl</a>
        </h2>
        <h1>Function</h1>
        <h2>
            Sketyl shows you your favorite tracks and artists, what you've listened to recently, and provides audio
            previews for each song.
        </h2>
        <h1>Author Notes</h1>

            Professionalism is my forte and it shows. Doesn't it? Sketyl is a cool name no? It's a random 6 letter word
            I came up with that happened to be for sale on namecheap for 4 bucks. Also cool because it sounds like
            skettle,
            which apparently is jamaican slang for prostitutes.
            Fuck I forgot to mention that the "Recent Tracks" and the "Liked Tracks" tabs will probably crap out for
            you.
            Spotify hasn't approved Sketyl for that yet. Not my fault, so yeah my code isn't shitty just because you see
            internal server errors. Well the code is sorta shitty, but that's not why it craps out. Also don't come and
            fuck me over
            for using someone else's photograph as a background image. Yes I mean that one up there ^. Beautiful isn't
            it? The
            photographer's name is Jan Erik Waider. I love his stuff.
            if you want to check his work out, click <a
                href="https://www.northlandscapes.com/portfolio/iceland-dark-and-monochrome" target="_blank">here.</a>
            Or just google
            him. I honestly couldn't care less what you do.
            Speaking of art, do you like the logo? Yes, the one that looks more like a deformed sperm than a 16th note.
            I drew it on the apple notes app (on my phone). I think I have a bright future as a
            digital artist wouldn't you agree? Or maybe even a painter?
