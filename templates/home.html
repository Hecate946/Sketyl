            Yes, I know this website looks terrible. It'll improve. Hopefully...
            Oh and yes all the code is on github. Just google "sketyl github" or something like that.
            Professionalism is my forte and it shows. Doesn't it? Sketyl is a cool name no? It's a random 6 letter word
            I came
            up with that happened to be for sale on namecheap for 4 bucks. Also cool because it sounds like skettle,
            which
            apparently is jamaican slang for prostitutes.
            Fuck I forgot to mention that a bunch of the tabs like recent tracks and playlists will probably crap out
            for you.
            Spotify hasn't approved Sketyl for that yet. Not my fault, so yeah my code isn't shitty just because you see
            internal server errors. Well the code is sorta shitty, but that's not why it craps out.
            Wuack is this dumbfuckery encouragement enough? When are you gonna make a homepage? :thinking:
        </h1>
        <h1>I can't believe people actually visit this thing, but I guess there are 7 billion people googling round the
            clock.
            So yeah... just click that spotify link up there ^^, or expand the hamburger if you're on mobile and connect
            your
            account. Why not? You already wasted 10 seconds reading this shit. Do you like the logo? Yes, the one that
            looks
            more like a deformed sperm than a 16th note. I drew it on the apple notes app. I think I have a bright
            future as a
            digital artist don't you agree? Or perhaps even a painter.
